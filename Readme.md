# Whatsapp-Bot-Hod

This project provides an easy way to implement WhatsApp bots using Node.js and the `whatsapp-web.js` library. 

## Features

- QR code generation for WhatsApp Web login
- Message listening and logging
- Session management

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the bot

## Usage

The bot will generate a QR code upon startup. Scan this QR code with your WhatsApp mobile app to log in. Once logged in, the bot will listen for incoming messages and log them to the console.

## Dependencies

- `qrcode-terminal`: A library to generate QR codes in the terminal

## Docker Support
